# TL;DR Chrome Extensionüîç

**The TL;DR Chrome Extension** summarizes and re-explains selected text on any webpage. It uses a lightweight proxy server to securely connect with the OpenAI API, giving you fast, clear summaries of dense content like news articles, blogs, and reports.

**This extension is currently not published; however you can view a video of how it works [here](https://youtu.be/21A77E1vTYg).

To run yourself:
1. Clone this repo:
2. Set up the proxy server (See my TL;DR Proxy github repo [here](https://github.com/danielyyi/TL-DR-Proxy-Server))
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.
3. Enable Developer Mode (top right).
4. Click *Load unpacked* and select the `/extension` folder.
